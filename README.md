# roman-arabic-number-converter🏛️🕙🔢

I have a Roman clock at home. One day I thought: 🤔Can I make a Roman number converter? So I started this small challenge.

At first I wasn't secure I could achieve it but I just wanted to try it. I wasn't believing to it, but after a couple of hours I got the Arabic to Roman conversion to work.

From there I started refactoring, fixing errors and building the reverse conversion. Awesome😄. Just believe in youself and keep trying. You'll get it!

- Valid inputs✅<br>
Just type the Roman or Arabic number, in lowercase or uppercase. The range of conversion is from 1 to 1000.
